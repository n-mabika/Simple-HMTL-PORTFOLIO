    <h1>The Best Movies According to Andile</h1>
    <h2>My top movies to watch in your spare time</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Home Alone</h3>
    <p>This is such a Christmas class. It brings all wonderful childhood memories during christmas day. I loved siting and watching Calvin being a menace every year.Good laughs. Most memorable Christmas movie to have ever been created.</p>
    <h3>UShaka Zulu</h3>
    <p>The movie is about the upbringing of a young boy destined to dethrone his father. Its a historical treasure to the Zulu Nation here in South Africa. Its brutal to watch but gives you the rich history of the Zulu Kingdom.</p>
    <h3>Van Damme-Kickboxer</h3>
    <p>Its an old martial-arts movie but one of the best to ever been created. The lead character is iconic and gave a fever dream to  any young WWE fan.</p>
